NOTE: since the cost_scaling_factor is multiplied by a negative in the formula, increasing the factor will decrease the resulting cost values. (double, default: 10.0)

This parameter is used as a failsafe to keep the navigation stack from commanding the robot when a sensor has failed. It should be set to a value that is slightly more permissive than the actual rate of the sensor. For example, if we expect a scan from a laser every 0.05 seconds we might set this parameter to be 0.1 seconds to give a generous buffer and account for some amount of system latency.
